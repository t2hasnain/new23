# Shoptik - Furniture eCommerce Web App
Shoptik is a full-stack eCommerce project designed to sell furniture online. The project uses modern technologies to provide an engaging user interface and a seamless shopping experience. The frontend of the project was developed using React, Context API, and React Router. Stripe was integrated as the payment gateway, and user authentication and authorization were implemented using Auth0.

For data storage, Airtable was used as a scalable and efficient database solution. Serverless functions were implemented on the backend to handle the processing of data and the communication between the frontend and the database.
